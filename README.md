## Overview

Reed Barger has guided me through a course demonstrating the ability to create a common e-commerce site, complete with stripe functionality.

This challenge's learning curve I tackled:
- implementation of full-stack progressive web app with database
- ensuring mobile navigation reacts accordingly

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Click through a multi-level navigation menu
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Click through various products
- See a common theme when paginating through site


### Live Site: [Add live site URL here](https://netlify.app/)

## My process


### Built with

- React Front-End Framework
- Modern JavaScript
- Express.js Back-End Framework
- Node.js
- MongoDB database

### What I learned


#### CSS

```css
some code

```

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is first and foremost the prominent language of this project. I am using React.js, Express.js, and Node.js to create this shopping site complete with a database. MERN stack is a common stack used going into 2022 and I thought this e-commerce site would 
demonstrate modern JavaScript and Progressive Web App practices.


```js
some code

```

### Continued development

I intend on researching SVGO for Optimizing SVG files incorporated in projects and how it affects performance and speed.
